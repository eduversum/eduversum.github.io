[**Substances** such as the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the chairs on which we sit, are made of **matter**.]{.grey}

Matter has a [**mass (m)**]{.primary} and occupies a [**space**]{.primary} or [**volume (V)**]{.primary}.
</slide>

<slide class="md">
Let's do a very simple exercise to familiarise ourselves with the concept of **matter:**

With about 3 or 4 classmates, choose 5 things around you — a pencil, an eraser, a rock, a glass, a shoe, a chair... anything you like.

How do they feel in your hand? Lift them one by one - can you tell if any of them is [**heavier**]{.primary} than the other?

Write down your order for the items, from lightest to heaviest, but **don't show your list to your classmates**.

[Write down your order for the items, from lightest to heaviest, but **don't show your list to your classmates**.]{.grey}

When everyone is ready, show your lists to each other and compare. Do your classmates have the same order as you? If not, compare the items again. Do you still think you're right? It would be difficult to tell without **scales**{.primary}.
</slide>

<slide class="md">
**Scales**{.primary} are tools that let us determine the **mass**{.primary} of an object. For example, doctors can use them to see how much we weigh, and we can also do that ourselves if we have scales at home. In the kitchen, some people use scales to measure ingredients, so that they can be sure they have the correct amounts.

**Chemists**{.primary} use scales to measure the quantities of the substances that they mix in their **experiments**{.primary}.

<slide class="md">
#### [Conclusions]{.primary}
_Heavier_ items have more [**mass**]{.primary} than _lighter_ items.

There are several reasons why this can happen but, in summary, we can conclude that heavier items are made of more **matter**{.primary} than the lighter items. We will see what exactly this means during the rest of this course, when we explore concepts such as _molecular weight_, _chemical composition_, _density_, and _aggregation state_.

Sometimes, when items have similar mass (such as two pencils), it can be difficult to tell which of them is heavier. To determine masses more accurately, we can use _scales_.
